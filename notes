---- wolfram alpha zegt:
if we dig up 5 meters below the ground we need to move  0.016705 km^3 (cubic kilometers)

which according to wolfram alpha is  ≈ 0.61 × volume of concrete used in the construction of the Three Gorges Dam (≈ 2.72×10^7 m^3 )

would make a cube with edges:

Edge length a of a cube from V = a^3:

Radius r of a sphere from V = 4πr^3/3:

palm jumeirah (Dubai) 5 * 5 km, constructie soort van klaar na 5 jaar

Construction resources involved  [wikipedia article about the palms https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Islands]

    5.5 million cubic metres of rock brought from over 16 quarries in Dubai.
    94 million cubic metres of sand brought from deep sea beds 6 nautical miles from the coast of Dubai.[9]
    210 million cubic metres of rock, sand and limestone

creating friesland volume 16 705 000 m3 = avg 12.57109 times less then Palm Jumeirah. 

http://www.dubaivacationtrips.com/islands.php: 

The total cost reached for construction of this Dubai Palm is $12.3 billion U.S. dollars and maintaining the island is a very expensive undertaking. Over 40,000 workers, mostly from South Asia have been employed in the construction of the Palm Jumeirah.

If we take this almost 13, (12.57...) as ballpark estimate, and divide the total cost by that number, the total cost would be something like 0.9784354 billion US dollars.  * .9636 to euros (some 2011 course) = 0.9428204 euro ?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flevoland
Flevoland was established on 1 January 1986, when the southern and eastern Flevopolders were merged into one province. Almost all of the land belonging to the province was reclaimed only in the 1950s and 1960s
1,419 km2


prijs:  afgraven (en afvoeren) van 1 m2 grond 30 cm diep kost Gemiddeld tussen de 12,50 & 17,50 euro

https://www.offerteadviseur.nl/categorie/tuin/hovenier/kosten-tuin-uitgraven/

    15 cm afgraven en afvoeren en ophogen met zand prijs per m2 €10 – €15
    20 cm afgraven en afvoeren en ophogen met zand prijs per m2 €15 – €20
    Uitgraven en afvoeren €8 – €12 per m2
    
https://www.hovenier-gigant.nl/tuin-afgraven-kosten/

So 1 m3 would be 

5 * 12.5 = 62.5 
5 * 17.5 = 87.5 

So: 16 705 000 m3

5 *17.5 * 16705000 = 1 461 687 500
1.5 billion euros
5 *12.5 * 16705000 = 1 044 062 500
1 billion euros

compared to other approximation .94.... billion . So sort of same cost.

 Peak of Insanity? Dutch Dream of Building Artificial Mountain

Dutch journalist Thijs Zonneveld wrote a column proposing the construction of an artificial mountain in the flat Netherlands as a joke. But the idea has captured the country's imagination and Zonneveld is now looking into its feasibility. After all, he says, in the past the country managed to reclaim massive areas of land from the sea.

2,000-meter (6,560-foot) peak appears to have caught the public's imagination. 

Zonneveld believes that it could be done for about €1 billion ($1.43 billion).  
 A hollow mountain would save an enormous amount of material. If it consisted of a mass of reinforced concrete, the colossus would weigh an estimated 5.2 trillion kilograms. If it were built out of stone, the mountain would be even heavier, and more expensive. 

UNFORTUNATLEY I THINK THE IDEA HAS DIED, BOTH LINKS IN THE 2001 ARTCLE WERE REMOVED
