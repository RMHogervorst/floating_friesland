In this project I'm trying to answer the question:

> could we dig up Friesland (or any other Dutch province) and float it away?

![an image of the Netherlands without Friesland]()

You might think: "Where did you get that ridiculous idea from?".

Friesland is one of the provinces of the Netherlands. 
The Frisians have a distinct culture and (internationally recognized and also official) language. 
Every once in a while when the newspapers have nothing else to record they will try to sensationalize news from 
Friesland. And sometimes that leads to someone saying: "why don't we just dig the province out and float it away?" [1].

And although the idea is ridiculous, it got me thinking...

Can it be done? 

So today we will determine:

- Can we dig away and float an entire province
- how long would it take and how much would it cost?
- if we don't float it away, can we make a mountain for skiing?






[1]: It's better in Dutch: "waarom steken we die provincie niet gewoon af en laten we die wegdrijven?"
